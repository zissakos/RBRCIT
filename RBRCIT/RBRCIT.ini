[ArchiveHandling]
# Optionally you can use an external program for unzipping files, like 7zip (recommended!).
# It will probably work with any other tool, however you will have to figure out the command line arguments pattern string.

# The path to the tool (for 7zip it is 7zg.exe), if you want to use an external unzip program.
# If this file does not exist (or this parameter is not set), RBRCIT will default to the internal unzipper ( before version 1.0.6).

# The command line arguments pattern string for extracting a file. %1% is the archive file and %2% is the output directory.
